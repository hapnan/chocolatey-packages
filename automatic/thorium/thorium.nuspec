<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://community.chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <summary>Chromium fork for Windows named after radioactive element No. 90</summary>
    <description># Thorium

## Chromium fork for linux named after [radioactive element No. 90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium). Windows/MacOS/RasPi/Android/Other builds see below.

- Always built with the latest stable version of [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/).
- Intended to behave like and have the featureset of Google Chrome, with differences/patches/enhancements listed below.
- Includes [Widevine](https://www.widevine.com/), [All Codecs](https://tools.woolyss.com/html5-audio-video-tester/), Chrome Plugins, as well as thinLTO, CFlag, LDFlag, LLVM Loop, and PGO compiler optimizations. It is built with [SSE4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4), [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions), and [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set), so it won't launch on CPU's below 2nd gen Core or AMD FX, but benefits from Advanced Vector EXtensions. If your CPU lacks AVX, you can use builds from the [Thorium SSE3](https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-SSE3) repo.

### FEATURES &amp; DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CHROMIUM AND THORIUM 
 - Various compiler flags that improve performance and target [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) CPU's (read [PATCHES.md](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/infra/PATCHES.md))
 - Experimental [MPEG-DASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP) support.
 - HEVC/H.265 support on Linux and Windows.
 - [JPEG XL](https://jpeg.org/jpegxl/) Image File Format turned on by default.
 - Enable [Live Caption](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/10538231?hl) (SODA) on all builds.
 - Experimental PDF annotation support (called "Ink" on ChromiumOS). # DISABLED FOR NOW BECAUSE OF CRASHES.
 - Patches from Debian including font rendering patch, VAAPI Patch, Intel HD support patch, native notifications patch, title bar patch, and... the VDPAU Patch!! (Rejoice Nvidia users)
 - VAAPI on Wayland Patch (Thanks AUR and @pierro78)
 - Audio Sandbox patch.
 - [DoH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS) (DNS over HTTPS) patches from Bromite.
 - Enable [Do Not Track](https://allaboutdnt.com/) by default patch from Vanadium.
 - Show full URLs including trailing slashes in address bar by default.
 - Disable [FLOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_Learning_of_Cohorts) patch.
 - Disable annoying Google API Key Infobar warning (you can still use API Keys to enable sync) from Ungoogled Chromium.
 - Disable annoying Default Browser Infobar warning.
 - Adds [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), [Brave Search](https://search.brave.com/), [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/), [Ask.com](https://www.ask.com/), and [Yandex.com](https://yandex.com/) in US and other locales, along with the normal search engines.
 - Always use the local NTP (New Tab Page) regardless of search engine.
 - Fix icons when distilling page content in [Reader Mode](https://www.howtogeek.com/423643/how-to-use-google-chromes-hidden-reader-mode/).
 - Enable new Menu UI when right clicking the Reload button. (Adds 'Normal Reload', 'Hard Reload', and 'Clear Cache and Hard Reload')
 - Home button and Chrome Labs shown by Default.
 - [Prefetch](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/dns-prefetching/) settings updated to respect privacy.
 - Patches for [GN](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/tools/gn/+/48062805e19b4697c5fbd926dc649c78b6aaa138/README.md) and [chrome_sandbox](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/design/sandbox.md) when building.
 - Remove the addition of the Chrome APT sources.list during installation.
 - Widevine CDM Patch for Linux.
 - GTK auto dark mode patch
 - Various new flags either developed from scratch, or added from Ungoogled Chromium. See [PATCHES.md](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/infra/PATCHES.md)
 - Enable Parallel Downloading by Default.
 - Inclusion of [pak](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/tree/main/pak_src#readme) a utility for packing and unpacking the [&#42;.pak](https://textslashplain.com/2022/05/03/chromium-internals-pak-files/) files in Thorium or any other Chromium based browser.
 - Logo and Branding/Naming changed to the Thorium logo, Thorium name, and "Alex313031" being appended to "The Chromium Authors" in credits, etc.
 - .desktop file includes useful cmdline flags that enable experimental or useful features. (See [PATCHES.md](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/infra/PATCHES.md))
 - Includes installer patches and files to include [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/home) and *thorium_shell* [(content_shell)](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/testing/web_tests_in_content_shell.md), with a .desktop file being provided for thorium_shell (named thorium-shell.desktop and shows in desktop environments as Thorium Content Shell). These are also included in the Windows releases, but it doesn't make a shorcut, although a .png and .ico is in the install directory for you to make your own shortcut with an icon. You can also run content_shell with the command thorium-shell (custom wrapper for it, located in /usr/bin/). You can run ChromeDriver at /usr/bin/chromedriver or chromedriver.exe on Windows. Also, patches for abseil library and mini_installer when building with AVX on Windows.
 - Right clicking the launcher after install gives three additional desktop actions, one to open thorium-shell, another to open in Safe Mode which disables any flags one has set in chrome://flags until the next launch, and lastly to open in Dark Mode which appends the --force-dark-mode flag.
- For more info, read the [PATCHES.md](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/infra/PATCHES.md) file.
- Known bugs are in the [BUGS.md](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/infra/BUGS.md) file.
