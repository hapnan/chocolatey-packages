<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://community.chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <summary>Chromium fork for Windows named after radioactive element No. 90</summary>
    <description># Thorium

## Chromium fork for linux named after [radioactive element No. 90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium). For Windows.

#### Package Parameters
    choco install thorium --params '"/params"'
The following package parameters can be set:

 * `/AVX` - for those of you who want to use the avx build
 * `/SSE3` - for those of you who want to use the sse3 build

### if you want to use AVX2 build use installation as usual 'choco install thorium'

- Always built with the latest stable version of [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/).
- Intended to behave like and have the featureset of Google Chrome, with differences/patches/enhancements listed below.
- Includes [Widevine](https://www.widevine.com/), [All Codecs](https://tools.woolyss.com/html5-audio-video-tester/), Chrome Plugins, as well as thinLTO, CFlag, LDFlag, LLVM Loop, and PGO compiler optimizations. It is built with [SSE4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4), [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions), and [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set), so it won't launch on CPU's below 2nd gen Core or AMD FX, but benefits from Advanced Vector EXtensions. If your CPU lacks AVX, you can use builds from the [Thorium SSE3](https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-SSE3) repo.
- For more info, read the [PATCHES.md](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/infra/PATCHES.md) file.
- Known bugs are in the [BUGS.md](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/infra/BUGS.md) file.
